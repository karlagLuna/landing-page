         <p> 
        My name is Karla, I'm very friendly person, I like challenges in life. I like to create things that make life easier, also, I am a creative person, discovering new methods or/and technologies.<br><br>

        I enjoy to practice sports, London it’s really good to use the bike how transport to everywhere, I am fan of this, also I love to swimming,  the feelings under the water it's indescribable how we can push our body to do the maximum to survive and coordinate the movement while you are swimming, any Sport it's a fundamental part of any person's healthy life.<br><br>

In 2015 I was learning programming, it was my first time, unfortunately I could not completed the course, but looking forward to complete with CYF.

The life is changing and the technology is part of our lives, this is the best time to learn Coding  and understand how we can improve and learn the function in the tecnology
 <br><br>

        I found the Program "Code for Your future", and made me feel motivated and once again I have the opportunity to get involve and gain the knowledge for my future career as a Web Developer.<br><br>

This page is example of what I am doing with CFY, this is my first page, at the beginning it can be frustrated and difficult but with effort and dedication we can make it better everytime. We have a big support everytime, 
They give us all material and knowledge to rich our goals<br><br>
